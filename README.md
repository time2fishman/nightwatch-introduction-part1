# Nightwatch Introduction

## Outline and Overview

We have here a basic calculator app that you will be utilizing to start your test automation career.  NightwatchJS is our automation framework of choice, and step by step you will become familiar with the process of automating tests.  One step at a time we'll build a set of automated tests to cover the requirements and acceptance criteria, which can be found below.  For each step in the project, you will use the corresponding folder in the `nightwatch` folder.

**IMPORTANT** You will run your tests for each test with the command `npm run step#` where # is the number of the step you're on.  (`npm run step1`, `npm run step2`, etc.)

**ALSO IMPORTANT** You need to start the application before running tests, use the command `npm start` to do so.

## Setup and Requirements

### Setup

To begin, fork and clone this repository. Once it has finished downloading `cd` into the project root and run `npm i` to fetch the project dependencies. After they are fetched run `npm start` and a browser window will open at `http://localhost:3000` displaying a (fully functional) calculator app.

* You will need to write up a `nightwatchProps.js` file, or copy one from another repository if you already have one.  There are some detailed instructions below on setting one up.

<details>

<summary> <code> nightwatchProps.js </code> </summary>

<br />

In this file we'll store the path to the `testing-resources` folder you created before, as well as the filenames for your `seleniumServer` and `chromedriver`.  **MAKE SURE** the version on your Selenium server matches the version on *your* machine.  Also the resource path needs to be to *your* testing resources folder, not to mine.

```js
module.exports = {
    resourcePath : "/Users/ajlarson/src/testing-resources/",
    seleniumServer: "selenium-server-standalone-3.6.0.jar",
    chromedriver: "chromedriver"
}
```

Note: For Windows computers, you have a different pathing format, so your `resourcePath` will look something like:
```js
    resourcePath : "C:\\Users\\AJ\\src\\testing-resources\\"
```
Note2: Also for Windows, your `chromedriver` listing needs to be `chromedriver.exe`
```js
    chromedriver: "chromedriver.exe"
```

</details>

### The Format

Every step is in a separate folder.  Look in the file explorer of the project, and compare it to the file tree below.  (Some of this is under construction, but this is what your starting file structure in the nightwatch folder will look like)

### Requirements For The Calculator

#### Basic Functionality

1. The display defaults to '0'
1. When numbers are keyed, the appropriate number appears on the display.  Subsequent numbers will be appended to the existing display, and no leading zeros will be included.
   * Pressing "1", "2", "0" the resulting display will be "120"
1. One decimal can be added to the number.  Only the first decimal click will be accepted.
1. When a mathematical operator is selected, the display will display a '0' until the subsequent number in the calculation is entered.
   * Pressing "1", "+" will result in a "0" on the display
1. Mathematical operations are completed appropriately when the "=" button is selected
   * Pressing "1", "+", "2", "=" will result in a "3" on the display

#### Additional Functionality

1. "+/-" is a key which will flip the positive/negative value of the current number
   * If "2.5" is displayed and "+/-" is selected, "-2.5" will be displayed and used in calculations instead
1. "%" will divide a number by 100 -- showing "decimal notation" for the percentage
   * If "81" is on the screen and the "%" button is selected, "0.81" will be displayed and used in future calculations
1. "A/C" will clear all pre-existing calculations and start fresh from an empty "0" display

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. The buttons should appear in an order and configuration consistent with most simple calculators
1. Complex chains of calculations should be possible
   * 12 + 2 / 42 - 3, take the result and continue, '%' * 530, etc
   * At least one test should be completed with a set of at least 40 button presses 


Now that we have setup out of the way, and you've had a chance to review the app's requirements, we can start in on actually testing it.

***

## Step 1

### Summary

For this assignment, we will forgo the need of formal test plans and test cases in JIRA.  Instead, we should come up with a consistent set of steps we can use in our testing.  The fact that this is a single page application makes things a lot simpler in that regard - one set of steps can fulfill our needs.  We'll take those and write a simple automated test.

### Instructions

* Outline an acceptable set of steps to check whether the calculator can perform calculations provided in a test case
* The test case would consist of the calculation to perform, and the expected result
* Create one simple test in the `step1/tests/tests.js` file.
* You can use plain strings for your `selectors` (i.e. `'button[name="equalsButton"]'` instead of something like `selectors.buttons.equal`)

<details>

<summary> Detailed Instructions </summary>

Based on the above rules, an effective set of test steps would be something like the following:

> 1. Click the listed buttons in sequence 
> 1. The display should update correctly after each button press

Super simple, but it would get the job done.

A matching test case could be like the following:

> **Precondition**: Open the calculator.  The calculation for the test is 2+2

> **Postcondition**: The displayed result is 4

Simplicity at its best, right?

Your `tests.js` file already exists in the `nightwatch/step1/tests` folder, and is configured with its `beforeEach`, `after`, etc.  Now you can add a test to the exported object as a new property, like below:

```js
//In nightwatch, tests are "properties" of the exported "test object", and the name of the test
//is the property's "key" while the test function is the "value".
'2+2=4' : browser => {
	
}
```

Remember, in objects, you have comma separated properties, and each property is comprised of a key and a value.  So in our test object `'2+2=4'` is now the key of a new property, and `browser => {}` is the value of the new property.

Populating this new test ought to be fairly straightforward.  We need to click the buttons, then read the final solution.  Use the **Inspector** tool in Google Chrome to build your selectors.  Remember when building your selector that any CSS selector will work (you can get more info [here](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp) on building selectors), but the ones that follow a `tag[attributeName=attributeValue]` format are the most effective in my experience.  These will help Nightwatch know EXACTLY what element (item in the page) to interact with.  For any test, you need selectors for anything you interact with, as well as anything you need to read/verify.  If I were going to pull selectors from this project, just for the test case listed above, they'll be for the `2`, `4`, `+` and `=` buttons.

<details>

<summary> Selectors for Step 1 </summary>

* `'button[name="2Button"]'`
* `'button[name="addButton"]'`
* `'button[name="equalsButton"]'`
* `'button[name="4Button"]'`
* `'span[name="result"]'`

</details>

Now I have all I need to automate a test.

1. A test case that includes data
1. A test procedure / test steps
1. Selectors

Using `NightwatchJS` functions to write this test out, I should only need two.  `.click()` and `.expect.element().text.to.equal()`.  Both are properties of the `browser` object and work as follows:

`.click()`
> Only needs a selector as an argument, i.e. `.click('button[name="equalsButton"]')`
> This will literally click whatever element the selector provided identifies, just as if we had clicked manually.

`.expect.element().text.to.equal()`
> A combination of functions, technically, all you really need to know is that the `.element()` part needs a selector, from which it will pull the text value.  The `.equal()` needs the value we expect to find in the element's text.  I.e. `.expect.element('span[name="result"]').text.to.equal('4')`
> This is an 'assertion', similar to `.assert` or `.verify` commands.  We use these to check and make sure results are as expected.  In this case, to check if the text contained within an element matches what we think it should be.
> Note: while you can chain `.click()`s and other functions one after another without having to type `browser` again, an `.expect` of any sort ends the chain.  Also, if an `.expect` fails, the test is marked failed, and all remaining steps are skipped.

Using these two bits of functionality from Nightwatch, I can write the simple test below.

```js
//In nightwatch, tests are "properties" of the exported "test object", and the name of the test is the property's "key" while the test function is the "value".
'2+2=4' : browser => {
	//I click all the appropriate buttons and check the display for the appropriate results, per the steps of my test case
	browser
		.click('button[name="2Button"]')
		.expect.element('span[name="result"]').text.to.equal('2')
	browser
		.click('button[name="addButton"]')
		.expect.element('span[name="result"]').text.to.equal('0')
	browser
		.click('button[name="2Button"]')
		.expect.element('span[name="result"]').text.to.equal('2')
	browser
		.click('button[name="equalsButton"]')
		.expect.element('span[name="result"]').text.to.equal('4')
}
```

After I've saved this test, I can run the `step1` tests using the command `npm run step1`.  Your results should look like this:

            .expect.element('span[name="result"]').text.to.equal('4')
    }
}
```

</details>

## Step 2

### Summary

Now that we've written a basic test and seen it run, now we can start to structure our test a little more clearly.  Here, we'll be using the `step2` folder inside of the `nightwatch` folder to define our selectors in one file, where they can be defined once and used multiple times.  This is much easier to use and much more maintainable.

### Instructions

* Create a folder for supporting files, I'm calling mine `supporting` this time.
* Inside of that folder, create a `selectors.js` file, and export an object containing all the selectors you may need for your tests.
* Require that object in your `tests.js` file, and refactor your original test to use the new selectors.

<details>

<summary> Detailed Instructions </summary>

First we need to create the `supporting` folder, inside of the `step2` folder, which is inside of the repository's `nightwatch` folder.  Then we can create the `selectors.js` file and start working with it.

In that `selectors.js` file we'll export our selectors object.

```js
module.exports = {

}
```

It's as simple as that.  Now we just need to populate the object with properites, where the key is the name of the selector, and the value is the selector itself.  I'm using the button's text to name my selectors personally.

The good news is that you already know how to build your selectors, `tag[attributeName=attributeValue]`.  We even had a few already in our last test.  So go out and start grabbing tags and attributes to build your selectors for all of the buttons in the calculator, and the display.

You can see how I got started below:

```js
module.exports = {
	'0' : 'button[name="0Button"]',
	'1' : 'button[name="1Button"]',
	//....
	'+/-' : 'button[name="negativeButton"]',
	//etc.
}
```

You get the idea.

With these selectors in our selector file, we can then require them in our `tests.js` file, back in the `tests` folder of `step2`.  It's already prepopulated with everything from `step1`, we just need to require the selectors now.

```js
//I'm making this a constant, so I don't accidentally change my selectors, 
//and then my require function uses the path from the tests.js file to the selectors file.
const selectors = require('../supporting/selectors')

module.exports = {
    beforeEach : browser => {
        browser.url('http://localhost:3000')
    },
```

That constant, `selectors`, in the `tests.js` file, now has assigned to it the object exported from our `selectors.js` file.  In other words, it has ALL the selectors we defined over there as its properties.

Now we're prepared to refactor our original `'2+2=4'` test with the selectors from our selectors file.  We can do this by replacing any of the plain string selectors (i.e. `'button[name="2Button"]'`) with a selector we defined in our `selectors.js` file.  We can access these by using the properties  on the `selectors` constant in the `tests.js` file (i.e. `selectors['2']`).

Here's an example of how I could do that.

```js
    '2+2=4' : browser => {
        //I click all the appropriate buttons and check the display for the appropriate results, per the steps of my test case
        browser
            .click(selectors['2'])
            .expect.element(selectors['result']).text.to.equal('2')
        browser
            .click(selectors['+'])
			.expect.element(selectors['result']).text.to.equal('0')
		//...
```

Now, after replacing all the string selectors with those from our `selectors.js` file, I can run my tests using the command `npm run step2` this time, with the following result:

            .expect.element(selectors['result']).text.to.equal('4')
    }
}
```

</details>

## Step 3

### Summary

An important step to testing any application is to look over its UI.  While it is possible to check EVERYTHING, from physical location, to what CSS attributes an element has, we'll just get into the habit of testing the UI by checking to see that all the elements we expect to be able to interact with are present and accounted for.  

There will be one other function we'll write that will click a button and check the expected result for us.  This can reduce the amount of code we're writing for now.

### Instructions

* Write a function that will look over the UI of the application
* Presence, visibility, and text should be verified
* This function should be executed before any other tests are run
* Then we'll tackle the button clicker

<details>

<summary> Detailed Instructions </summary>

In Step 2 you created a new `supporting` folder for your `selectors.js` file.  You may have named them something else, but that's the same folder we'll use to create a `functions.js` file.  Model it's initial setup after your `selectors.js` file, meaning we'll use the `module.exports` format to export an object that will eventually contain our functions.  I won't be showing you that part of the code specifically in this step, I want you to be able to find it and write it yourself.

Now that we have somewhere to put our new functions, we'll look at the UI checker first.  We should do the following:
1. Check every button for visibility
1. Check every button for the text it ought to be displaying
1. Check the display for visibility and its default text

As I said in the summary, we can do more, but this is a GREAT start for our automated test.  So considering what we want our function to do, we'll need to figure out if we need any inputs/arguments, and if it needs to output/return anything.
1. We'll need the selectors for all of the buttons and the display
   * The good news here is that you gathered these in Step 2.  We can either pass them in when the function is called, or just require them and make them available to the whole functions file.  We'll do the latter.
1. We need the text for each button and the default displayed text
   * Since we're not going to be using these anywhere else, I'm happy to just define them right there in the function for now.
1. We need to pass or fail the UI check
   * The easiest way for us to do this will be to pass our function the `browser` object we've been using with Nightwatch, so that we can write our `expect` statements right in the function and it will pass or fail right there.

Now that we've identified what our function is going to do (check the buttons and display for visibility and displayed text), arguments it needs (the `browser`), and what it returns (nothing in this case), we can get writing.  We'll comment this function before we write it.  There is a format of comment called JSDoc that generates the popup prompt for us to use every time the function is called.  Not only does it explain what the function does, but it makes sure we (or any other developer using our function) knows how to use it correctly.

There are some great [docs on GitHub](https://github.com/shri/JSDoc-Style-Guide) for JSDoc.

To start, we'll open the comment explaining our function with `/** */` - you can see it's like a regular block comment, but has an extra asterisk right at the start.  Inside the opening and closing marks there we can explain what our function does.  Note:  Put this up at the top of the `functions.js` file, outside of the exported object.  We'll add our function to the export a bit later.

```js
/**
 * Looks over the UI to make sure needed elements are visible and displaying the right text.  (Buttons and the display)
 */
```

This will already give a bit more info when anyone wants to use the function in their test, but we'll go a step further.  We can use the `@param` syntax that JSDoc takes advantage of to make sure anyone using the function knows what parameters or arguments are needed... In this case, it's an `{object}`, the `browser`.

```js
/**
 * Looks over the UI to make sure needed elements are visible and displaying the right text.  (Buttons and the display)
 * 
 * @param {object} browser     an object provided by NightwatchJS which hooks into the test browser
 */
```

For us, this is all we'll need for our JSDoc comment, since there are no other arguments and nothing is being returned.  Now we can start our function.  We're going to make it a `const` named `uiChecker`.  When we're done, we'll add it to the object being exported from the `functions.js` file.

```js
/**
 * Looks over the UI to make sure needed elements are visible and displaying the right text.  (Buttons and the display)
 * 
 * @param {object} browser     an object provided by NightwatchJS which hooks into the test browser
 */
const uiChecker = browser => {

}
```

Since the function is declared right after we close the JSDoc comment, our code editor knows to match the comment to this function.  Now let's comment out in our function what we need to do so we don't forget.

```js
const uiChecker = browser => {
    //check elements for visibility
    
    //check elements for displayed text

}
```

Oh!  If we're going to check our elements, we need selectors!  We can't forget those.  At the very top of our file (just like we do in our test files) we'll use `require` to grab those selectors.

```js
const selectors = require('./selectors')
```

Because the `selectors.js` file is in the same `supporting` folder as our `functions.js` file, we can use `'./selectors'` for the require, where the `./` is telling the require statement we're just looking in the folder we're already in.

Now that we have our selectors available, we can actually start populating our function with the checks!  There are two ways we could go about this.
1. Check each element manually
1. Loop through all elements in the selectors file

I'm not going to loop through these selectors; where we are going to be defining the text to check for each manually, we'll need to write out a line or two for each anyway.

Let's get to it! `//check elements for visibility` was our first reminder, so let's write a `browser.expect` statment for each element to check that they are all visible!  You can always review the [NightwatchJS API Docs](http://nightwatchjs.org/api) (which I recommend) but I'll tell you this time, it's `browser.expect.element().to.be.visible`.  I'll give you a few examples below to get you started.

```js
    browser.expect.element(selectors['0']).to.be.visible
    browser.expect.element(selectors['1']).to.be.visible
    // and so on through all the buttons until you get to the end
    browser.expect.element(selectors['result']).to.be.visible
```

The next point is to `//check elements for displayed text` - again I'll give you just a few to get started.  This should be familiar  stuff as well (`browser.expect.element().text.to.equal()`).  The thing to remember here is just that we're setting the expected text manually, not pulling it from an external file.

```js
    browser.expect.element(selectors['0']).text.to.equal('0')
    browser.expect.element(selectors['1']).text.to.equal('1')
    // and so on through all the buttons until you get to the end
    browser.expect.element(selectors['result']).text.to.equal('0')
```

With our function checking visibility and the displayed text, we're good to go.  Let's add this to our exported object, and bring it into our test!

Remember how we assigned the function to the constant `uiChecker`?  We're going to make the value of a property on the exported object equal to `uiChecker`.  See below:

```js
module.exports = {
    uiChecker: uiChecker
}
```

Looks kind of funny right?  This is literally saying, "Set the property uiChecker = to some variable or constant that exists already and is named uiChecker."  Saying `billyBob: uiChecker` would work too, and might be a little clearer in some ways, but would be more confusing in others.

Now we can require the functions file in our `tests.js` file.

```js
const functions = require('../supporting/functions')
```

All that's left to do for this function is to create a new test, preferably the first test that runs.  This is so that if the UI is totally broken, we skip the rest of the tests on Nightwatch's current configuration.

We'll create the new test right after the `after` function is declared, and before the first custom test (one with a string name) is declared.

```js
    after : browser => {
        browser.end()
    },
    'UI Check' : browser => functions.uiChecker(browser),
    '2+2=4' : browser => {
```

Now lets run the test using `npm run step3`, and see how we do!

I'm only showing the very end, but you can see that adding the `UI Check` test, which was really just running our `uiChecker()` function, we added 40 new assertions!  Good work.

With our first function out of the way, we can try one that's a little less striaghtforward.  This is the function that clicks a button and verifies the display.

```js
/**
 * Clicks a button and checks that the resulting display is correct.
 * If the button clicked is a special operator (=, %, +/-), we won't
 * check the result in this function. 
 * @param {object} browser     an object provided by NightwatchJS which hooks into the test browser
 * @param {string} button      the key of the button to click (corresponds to the keys in selectors.js)
 */
```

If you can read the above, you can see that this function will take a browser and a button as inputs.  With no `@return` defined, we know we won't bother returning any information either.

We can fully declare the function, as a constant again, and we'll give it a very creative name...

```js
/**
 * Clicks a button and checks that the resulting display is correct.
 * If the button clicked is a special operator (=, %, +/-), we won't
 * check the result in this function.
 *  
 * @param {object} browser     an object provided by NightwatchJS which hooks into the test browser
 * @param {string} button      the key of the button to click (corresponds to the keys in selectors.js)
 */
const buttonClicker = (browser, button) => {
    //click the button

    //verify the display if NOT a special operator
    
}
```

We can set up the button click portion pretty easily.  Remember how we required the `selectors.js` export into `functions.js` earlier?  We only need to use Nightwatch's `.click()` function for that step.  The important thing here is that we'll use the selector named by the `button` parameter, which is defined as needing to be a key from that file anyway ('0', 'AC', etc).

```js
    //click the button
    browser.click(selectors[button])
```

That takes care of that.  Now to verify the display.  To do this, the first thing we need to do is have something that will track the display between button clicks (since hitting multiple numbers in a row can create a long string of numbers in the display, we can't just check one number at a time).  We'll do this by declaring a variable in the functions file (probably right above the JSDoc for `buttonClicker`) called `currentDisplay` and set it to `'0'`.

```js
// keeps track of the number on the calculator display screen based
// on button clicks
var currentDisplay = '0'
```

We have an easy start - we've declared that we won't check the display for the listed "special operators" =, % and +/-.

```js
    //if the button is one of the listed 'special operators' we'll just end our function now.
    if (button === '=' || button === '%' || button === '+/-')
        return
```

Now we can start getting into the thick of it.  First, I want to define a couple of functions.

*isNaN()*
> Takes an input.  If it is a number, returns false.  If it is 'not a number' returns true.

*parseInt()*
> Takes an input.  If it is a number (even in a string) returns that number.  Otherwise, returns 'NaN' (not a number)

We know based on how the calculator works, if anything else that is not a number (besides '.') is clicked, the display is reset to '0'.  We can check for that in our function, so that we expect the right result.

```js
//if the button clicked is not a number or decimal, we handle it a little differently.
    if (isNaN(parseInt(button)) && button !== '.') {
        //current display is returned to 0
        currentDisplay = '0'
        browser.expect.element(selectors['result']).text.to.equal('0')
    }
```

To handle number clicks (or decimal clicks) we have things a little easier.  We may need to replace a zero on the screen (if the display is '0' and we didn't press the decimal), otherwise we just add the new number to the existing number on the screen, and expect the new result.

```js
    else {
        //if the current display is 0, the button clicked will replace it, unless the button is a period.
        if (currentDisplay === '0' && button !== '.')
            currentDisplay = button
        //otherwise, the button clicked is appended to the current display
        else
            currentDisplay += button
        //either way, now we can check the updated display
        browser.expect.element(selectors['result']).text.to.equal(currentDisplay)
    }
```

The resulting function is a little complicated, but it will certainly work.  Finally, we can add the `buttonClicker` function to our exported object.

```js
module.exports = {
    uiChecker: uiChecker,
    buttonClicker: buttonClicker
}
```

We can now write up a new test, using the `buttonClicker`.

In our `tests.js` file, let's create a new test, 32.1*2=64.2.  This will check decimals, multi-digit, and a couple of operators.  We'll call `buttonClicker` for each button press, and then `expect` the proper result.

```js
    '32.1*2=64.2' : browser => {
        functions.buttonClicker(browser, '3')
        functions.buttonClicker(browser, '2')
        functions.buttonClicker(browser, '.')
        functions.buttonClicker(browser, '1')
        functions.buttonClicker(browser, '*')
        functions.buttonClicker(browser, '2')
        functions.buttonClicker(browser, '=')
        browser.expect.element(selectors['result']).text.to.equal('64.2')
    }
```

This test gave our function a bit of a workout, but it works!  Run the tests again (`npm run step3`)

You should get something similar to this!  If not, look back over your functions and test, you can also compare the files to the code solution below.

Good work easing into the world of functions - we'll look at one in our next step that will make life even easier for future testing efforts!

## Step 4

### Overview

This may well be the simplest step of the 5...  We're going to refactor our existing tests and write one new one using a data file.

### Instructions

* Create a file `data.js` in your `step4/supporting` folder
* Require this in the `tests.js` file and use it for all your data (inputs, expected results, etc)
* Ideally you can do this without referring to the detailed instructions
* We haven't tested the '%' button yet, or '+/-', so we'll do that in the new test
